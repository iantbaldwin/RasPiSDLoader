To run, you must use $ ./sdutil.sh instead of sh sdutil.sh. Not sure why, probably a difference in the way the execute the commands.

Known issues:
Occasionally dd throws a random Input/Output error and continues on without error, just rerun the command and it should work.

Will add a copy of config.txt to the newly created disk
